    This program makes a first exploration of all the input
    material we have, it prints out information like:
    - How big the input folder is (bytes)
    - How many raw text material is available (bytes), i. e. 
      w/o meta-data
    - How many symbols are used 
    - How many tokens, words, stems etc. are available
    
    TBD: 
    - Add params to this program or make it more user-friendly /
      interactive.
    - Add more outcome, probably not only quantitative, but also
      qualitative information.
    - Put some of the (verbose) text into other classes.
