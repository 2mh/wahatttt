wahatttt - wh4t software:
=========================

Goals:
------
The goal of the project "wh4t" (shortened form of "wahatttt") 
is to create a text-technologically traversed archive of e-mails
origining from Herwart Holland-Moritz (also known as Wau Holland,
or simply "[Ww]au", born 1951). The idea is to classify the
e-mails of Wau upon topics and (in a later phase) to visualize
this information in a suitable way for the interested public.

What should emerge is (kind of) a picture of the (varying) 
areas Wau was active in, presented in a structured way.

Wau was one of the founding figures of the Chaos Computer Club (CCC), 
the biggest Hacker Foundation in Europe, with today hackerspaces all
over Europe, which are directly or indirectly related / connected
to the CCC.

After his (early) death in 2001 the Wau Holland Foundation
(German: Wau-Holland-Stiftung or WHS) emerged in order to make his works
public and keep his ideas and ideals alive.


Setting of this project:
------------------------
This project emerges from an idea and some prior work done by
Bernd Fix of the WHS. However, it's now (independently) carried
out as a student programming project at the University
of Zurich (UZH).

Data/source Text:
------------------
The text material used -- for the time being -- comes from the
debate@ FITUG mailing list. FITUG stands for
"FÃ¶rderverein Informationstechnik und Gesellschaft", roughly
meaning "Booster club (for) information technology and society". 
From a corpus point of view the texts are likely to be full of
computational technical terms, but also enriched with expressions
from political/sociological fields.

It's (prior) archives are publicly available:
* http://www.fitug.de/debate/index.html

Wau used to post on debate@ between 1996 and 2000.

Further data may be gathered from the (Google) USENET archives
or from (not yet publicly) available material being held in Berlin,
Germany.

These additional data will be subject of inclusion in later project
phases.


what or wahatttt is this name about?
------------------------------------
"wahatttt" stands for "what" in a longish, not quite correctly
spelled version, and is actually a word (as of the Urban
Dictionary):
* http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wahatttt

Alternatively, it may be an acronym for the following (longish)
constructions; in German:
(1) WAu HollAnd - TexT-Technologisch-Traversiert
(2) WAu Hacker-Archiv - TexT-Technologisch-Traversiert

Or, put in English, it may (further) stand for:
(3) WAu Holland -- TexT-Technologically-Traversed
(4) WAu Hacker Archive -- TexT-Technologically-Traversed

All these ambiguities -- starting already in the name of the
project -- our out here for something: They are here to
symbolize the difficulties this project faces.


Software requirements:
----------------------
wh4t was tested with the following software:

$ java -version 
java version "1.6.0_18"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.8.13) (6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1)
